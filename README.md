For this assignment we have created a repo with a README file, then created our own branches with our names where we also have created a file with our names. Later we have merged these personal branches to master branch.

To practice merge conflict, we have created a file on our own branch with the name of our peers with different content and tried to merge it to master branch. We solved the conflict by adding all changes.
